## This script is designed to copy one repo (usually from a company or university) into your own for personal use. This script is specifically designed to save all code created as a Boise State University student from the classroom repository into your own. If you are using a different organization, you will have to edit that in the script.

## To run this program, you will need two (maybe three) things: 
1. Your GitHub username. This can be easily obtained off of GitHub. enter in username field.
2. A GitHub authentication token. This can be obtained by going to GitHub>settings>developer settings> tokens. Your token will need repo access. WRITE DOWN YOUR TOKEN ELSEWHERE AS IT IS ONLY GIVEN ONCE.
3. Installation of the requests python package. This (at least for me) does not come pre-installed. I use brew as a package manager, so in the terminal you will need to run "brew install python-requests"

## Once you have these things, you will need to edit fileName.txt to include your username:
## Have fun and enjoy your code for yourself!
